Instructions

One of the critical functions that we provide for our clients is the ability to pay for their employees’ 
benefits packages. A portion of these costs are deducted from their paycheck, 
and we handle that deduction. Please demonstrate how you would code the following scenario:

	 The cost of benefits is $1000/year for each employee
	 Each dependent (children and possibly spouses) incurs a cost of $500/year
	 Anyone whose name starts with ‘A’ gets a 10% discount, employee or dependent

We’d like to see this calculation used in a web application where employers input employees and their dependents, and get a preview of the costs. This is of course a contrived example.
We want to know how you would implement the application structure and calculations and get a brief preview of how you work.
Please implement a web application based on these assumptions:
	 All employees are paid $2000 per paycheck before deductions
	 There are 26 paychecks in a year
